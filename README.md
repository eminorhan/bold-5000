## fMRI signals from visual cortical areas are too noisy to distinguish between even drastically different image recognition models 

To whom thus *Adam* cleerd of doubt, repli’d.
How fully hast thou satisfi’d mee, pure
Intelligence of Heav’n, Angel serene,
And freed from intricacies, taught to live,
The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts

-- *Paradise Lost* (Book VII)

This project is work in progress and aims to determine the minimal model capable of fully accounting for the variance observed in a large dataset of visual fMRI responses to natural images ([BOLD5000](https://bold5000.github.io/)). I am hoping to have a write-up of the results in the next couple of months.

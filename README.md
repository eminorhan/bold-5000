## fMRI signals from visual cortical areas are too noisy to distinguish between even drastically different image recognition models 

This project is work in progress and aims to determine the minimal model capable of fully accounting for the variance observed in a large dataset of visual fMRI responses to natural images ([BOLD5000](https://bold5000.github.io/)). I am hoping to have a write-up of the results in the next few weeks.
